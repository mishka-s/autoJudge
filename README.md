# 🧠 AutoJudge: Automatic Programming Problem Difficulty Estimation

## 📌 Project Overview

Online competitive programming platforms such as **Codeforces, CodeChef, and Kattis** assign difficulty labels (Easy / Medium / Hard) and numerical difficulty scores to programming problems. These labels are largely based on **human judgment and community feedback**, making the process subjective and time-consuming.

This project, **AutoJudge**, aims to **automatically estimate the difficulty of programming problems using only textual information**, without relying on tags, constraints metadata, or user statistics.

The system performs **two tasks**:

1. **Classification Task**  
   Predict the difficulty class → **Easy / Medium / Hard**

2. **Regression Task**  
   Predict a **numerical difficulty score**

A **Streamlit web application** is provided where users can paste a new problem description and instantly receive both predictions.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Use **only textual content** of programming problems
- Build:
  - a **classification model** for difficulty class
  - a **regression model** for difficulty score
- Understand the limitations of text-based difficulty estimation
- Deploy the solution via a **simple web UI**

---

## 🗂 Dataset Description

Each data sample contains:

- `title`
- `description`
- `input_description`
- `output_description`
- `problem_class` → Easy / Medium / Hard
- `problem_score` → numerical difficulty value

📌 The dataset is assumed to be **pre-labeled** and is not created or annotated as part of this project.

---

## ⚙️ Text Preprocessing

All textual fields are **combined into a single input string**:

title + description + input_description + output_description


Preprocessing steps:
- Lowercasing text
- Removing extra whitespace
- No aggressive stemming or lemmatization (to preserve programming-specific terms like `dp`, `dfs`, `mod`)

---

## 🧩 Feature Engineering

To capture both semantic and structural information, a **hybrid feature representation** was used.

### 🔹 TF-IDF Features
- Unigrams and bigrams
- Captures important keywords and phrases
- Forms the core representation of problem text

### 🔹 Hand-Crafted Structural Features
Added to inject domain knowledge:

1. **Log-scaled text length**  
   Longer problems often correspond to higher difficulty

2. **Algorithmic keyword frequency**  
   Keywords such as:

   dp, graph, dfs, bfs, recursion, binary search, greedy

   
3. **Mathematical symbol density**  
Frequency of symbols like `= < > + - * %`, indicating mathematical complexity

All features are concatenated as:

[ TF-IDF | text length | keyword count | math symbol density ]

## 🧪 Classification Models (Difficulty Class)

### Models Tried

| Model | Outcome |
|----|----|
| Logistic Regression | Collapsed to majority class |
| Multinomial Naive Bayes | Weak separation, strong bias |
| **Linear SVM** | Best balanced performance |

---

### ⚠️ Problems Faced During Classification

1. **Severe Class Imbalance**
   - “Hard” problems dominated the dataset
   - Initial models predicted only the majority class

2. **Overlapping Vocabulary**
   - Easy, Medium, and Hard problems share very similar wording
   - Boilerplate input/output formats reduce discriminative power

3. **Subjective Labels**
   - Difficulty categories are not sharply defined even for humans

---

### ✅ Final Classification Model

- **Linear Support Vector Machine (LinearSVC)**
- TF-IDF + structural features
- `class_weight="balanced"`

### 📊 Classification Results

- Accuracy ≈ **47%**
- Hard problems are identified more reliably
- Easy vs Medium confusion remains high

📌 This performance is **realistic** for a text-only difficulty classification task.

---

## 🧪 Regression Models (Difficulty Score)

Unlike classification, predicting a **continuous score** is often more stable.

### Models Tried

| Model | MAE | RMSE |
|----|----|----|
| Linear Regression | Weak baseline |
| **Random Forest Regressor** | **1.70** | **2.04** |
| Gradient Boosting Regressor | 1.70 | 2.04 |

---

### ✅ Final Regression Model

- **Random Forest Regressor**
- TF-IDF + structural features
- Chosen for:
  - Slightly better robustness
  - Easier interpretability
  - Comparable performance to Gradient Boosting

---

### 📊 Regression Evaluation

- **MAE ≈ 1.7**
- **RMSE ≈ 2.0**
- Difficulty score range ≈ 1–10

This corresponds to a **~20% relative error**, which is reasonable given:
- Subjective ground truth
- Use of text-only information

📌 Regression consistently outperformed classification in reliability.

---

## 🌐 Streamlit Web Application

A **Streamlit-based interface** allows users to:

- Paste:
  - Problem description
  - Input description
  - Output description
- Get:
  - Predicted difficulty class
  - Predicted difficulty score

The app loads **pre-trained models** and does not retrain at runtime.

### ▶️ Run Locally

pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

📌 Large model files are tracked using Git LFS.

## 🧠 Key Learnings & Insights

- Difficulty classification is **harder than score regression**
- Text alone has limited ability to distinguish Easy vs Medium
- Structural features improve performance marginally
- Model performance plateaus due to inherent task ambiguity
- Deployment requires **feature consistency** between training and inference

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Parse constraint values explicitly (e.g., `n ≤ 10^5`)
- Hierarchical classification (Easy vs Non-Easy)
- Use transformer-based embeddings
- Incorporate problem tags if available

---

## 📌 Conclusion

**AutoJudge** demonstrates a complete end-to-end NLP + ML pipeline for estimating programming problem difficulty using textual data alone. While classification accuracy is inherently limited by subjective labels, regression-based difficulty estimation provides meaningful and stable predictions. The project highlights both the **potential and limitations** of automated difficulty estimation.
